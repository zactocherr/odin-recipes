            While this dish isn't exceptionally hard to make it does require a but of 
            equipment and grit to make. The dish is a comfort food featuring rich Coconut
            rice infused with ginger, garlic, scallion, and textured with toasted cashews. 
            The chicken thighs absorb the coconut milk as they cook, which leads to a tender 
            meat filled with juices ready to be released. Finally, the freshly chopped cilantro 
            adds a bright spot to the dish, while the hot sauce gives a little kick to balance the
            creamy and rich rice.
