        <h3><strong>What is Coconut Chicken Rice</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Coconut chicken rice doesn't necessarily come from anywhere specific.
            However, that doesn't mean its not tasty. This delicious dish will have
            you ranting and raving to your friends about how great of a chef you are. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While this dish isn't exceptionally hard to make it does require a but of 
            equipment and grit to make. The dish is a comfort food featuring rich Coconut
            rice infused with ginger, garlic, scallion, and textured with toasted cashews. 
            The chicken thighs absorb the coconut milk as they cook, which leads to a tender 
            meat filled with juices ready to be released. Finally, the freshly chopped cilantro 
            adds a bright spot to the dish, while the hot sauce gives a little kick to balance the
            creamy and rich rice.
