        <h3><strong>What is Thai Curry?</strong></h3>
        <p>Frankly, <em>Thai Curry</em> is a set of spices mixed together in a sauce 
            or a paste combined with vegetables, a protein source such as beef 
            or chicken, and is usually served with rice. The result of this 
            combination is a dish bursting with diverse flavors. 
        </p>
        <p>The greatest part about Thai curry is the endless customization. 
            You aren’t stuck to one way of making it, you can choose just 
            the right balance of heat, salt, sour and sweet for your pallet t
            o enjoy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thai curry is not only a delicious cuisine but is one that tells a story 
            of the land where it comes from. When traveling to various parts of the 
            country you’ll find that the curries will be different. Curry from the south 
            parts of Thailand will have a more rich numeric and peppercorn flavors found 
            within them since they are grown easily in those areas. However, curry from 
            Bangkok will have almost no turmeric in the flavor profile. In Bangkok they 
            use more red and dry chilies along with galangal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, Thai curries reflect the richness and agricultural diversity 
            found within each of its regions.
