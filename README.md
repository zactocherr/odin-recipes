# odin-recipes
This will be an HTML page of recipes collected by me. The goal of this project is to practice the HTML I have been learning and produce a functioning structure for a web page. 

This project will include relative and aboslute links, headings of multiple sizes, bold and italicised fonts, along with images and alt text for images.
