            Chef, boy are these people not ready for the explosion of flavor about to hit their mouths.
        </p>

            Below is a small list of my favorite dishes to make and eat. Each dish is relatively simple
            by design, but not designed by me. These should not take long to prepare and have some serious
            kicks of flavor found within them. Be careful while eating because I promise you they're addictive.
